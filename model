Step 1 (Narrative)
  Businesses buy elektricity on different markets, the closer the marget gets to
  real time, the more expensive it gets.
  A business can decide how much he uses each hour a day in advance. On the day
  of delivery the actual usage of a business can differ from the delivered.
  The elektricity used on that moment is way more expensive and is bought on the
  imbalance market. On this market, elektricity prices change every quarter
  depending on the system imbalance. The more imbalanced, the more the cost.
  Business can lower the price they need to pay by using batteries to buffer in
  times their are high prices, or even to sell when their is a big negative
  price.
